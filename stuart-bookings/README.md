## Stuart Booking App

Hey, thanks for inviting me to participate in this challenge, it was really fun including the hidden console log clues :)

## Technical Arch

Languages and libraries chosen:
JavaScript
React
Google Maps API
Google Fonts
Stuarts API
HTML & CSS
SASS

## Future changes

If I had more time I would have structured the app differently and focused more on clean code in particular by changing the class components to functional components and using useReducer to share state, instead of sharing the state via props using google map. This would have allowed me to split the functions out futher.

## Commands

npm install - install all dependencies,
npm build - build the code,
npm start - start a developer web server,
