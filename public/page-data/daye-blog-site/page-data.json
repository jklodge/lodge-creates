The purpose of this site was to be faster and have an improved SEO compared to the old PHP blog site. I used Gatsby because as a static site generator it generates the content during build time which gives the site a much faster feel when clicking through the content. SEO is also improved as it's much easier for crawlers to find the content as it's built during build time rather than fetched afterwards."},"site_link":{"url":"https://yourdaye.com/"},"image":{"url":"https://images.prismic.io/lodgecreates/bc8b3aa3-bf51-469b-aecf-7263eaf94d33_vitals.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=50"},"built_with":{"text":"This site was built with React, Gatsby, Typescript and Prismic."}}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2926c45d-a28a-555e-a3b7-cebdebf165ac"}}}
